  See https://github.com/bohning/usdb_syncer/wiki/Meta-Tags for a full list of
  supported tags.

<!-- 0.8.0 -->

# Changes

## Fixes

- Age-restricted content can now be successfully downloaded if you are logged in to
  YouTube in your browser.

## Features

- Custom data may be added to downloaded songs as key-value pairs.
- The download path can now be customized using a dedicated template syntax (see
  _Settings_). The template must contain at least two components, which are separated
  using slashes. The last component specifies the filename, excluding its extension.
  Example: `:year: / :artist: / :title: / song` will store files like
  `1975/Queen/Bohemian Rhapsody/song.txt` and so on.
  - You can even reference custom data with `:*my_key:`, which resolves to the value
    associated with `my_key` for a given song.
- Searches can be saved to the sidebar.
  - A single saved search may be made the default to automatically apply it on startup.
  - You can subscribe to saved searches to automatically download matches when new songs
    are found on USDB.
- Comments can now be posted on songs. Each comment includes a message and a rating.
  Ratings can be negative, neutral, or positive, with neutral being the default.
- The VP9 codec can be excluded for mp4 video containers (see _Settings_).
- Tags such as artist, title and year are now also written to the video file (mp4 only).
- Some text file fixes are now optional and can be configured in the settings:
  - fix linebreaks (disabled | USDX style | YASS style)
  - fix first words capitalization (disabled | enabled)
  - fix spaces (after words | before words)
- We're trying out a hook system to make the syncer extensible. See addons/README.md.

## Developer notes

- We have upgraded to Python 3.12.
- The build process was migrated to Poetry. Pipenv is no longer used.
  See the README for instructions.

<!-- 0.7.0 -->

# Changes

## Fixes

- Fixed xcb and wayland not being bundled, which prevented the app to run on Linux.

## Features

- USDB has expanded their song list to include the audio sample URL. By pressing space or
  clicking the play icon you can play back this sample.
  If the song is locally available, the local file is played instead
  (starting at #PREVIEW if it is set).

  now populated without fully downloading a song, and respective filters were added.

# Changes

## Features

  the download fails.
- Downloads may be aborted or paused.
- Support Ogg/Opus (.opus) audio format.
